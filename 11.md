Fixed code with an initial value for the accumulator:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] });  // Initial object with "evens" and "odds" properties

console.log(result);



// OUTPUT:
{ evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }

```


## Explaination

We have an array numbers containing the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The reduce method accumulates the values of the array into a single result. We use an object as the accumulator (acc), initialized with properties evens and odds.
For each number in the numbers array, the callback function is called. 
If the number is even (divisible by 2), it is pushed into the accumulator's evens array or else the odds array.
After iterating through all the numbers in the numbers array, the reduce method returns the final accumulated object.
The console.log(result) statement logs the final result,
// OUTPUT:
{ evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }
